1740. Find Distance in a Binary Tree

Given the root of a binary tree and two integers p and q, return the distance between the nodes of value p and value q in the tree.

The distance between two nodes is the number of edges on the path from one to the other.

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 edges between 5 and 0: 5-3-1-0.
Example 2:


Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 edges between 5 and 7: 5-2-7.
Example 3:


Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: The distance between a node and itself is 0.
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 104].
0 <= Node.val <= 109
All Node.val are unique.
p and q are values in the tree.
