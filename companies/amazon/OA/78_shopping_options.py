Disappeared shopping options question, retrieved from google cache

A customer wants to buy a pair of jeans, a pair of shoes, a skirt, and a top but has a limited budget in dollars. Given different pricing options for each product, determine how many options our customer has to buy 1 of each product. You cannot spend more money than the budgeted amount.

Example
priceOfJeans = [2, 3]
priceOfShoes = [4]
priceOfSkirts = [2, 3]
priceOfTops = [1, 2]
budgeted = 10

The customer must buy shoes for 4 dollars since there is only one option. This leaves 6 dollars to spend on the other 3 items. Combinations of prices paid for jeans, skirts, and tops respectively that add up to 6 dollars or less are [2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [3, 2, 1], [2, 3, 1]. There are 4 ways the customer can purchase all 4 items.

Function Description

Complete the getNumberOfOptions function in the editor below. The function must return an integer which represents the number of options present to buy the four items.

getNumberOfOptions has 5 parameters:
int[] priceOfJeans: An integer array, which contains the prices of the pairs of jeans available.
int[] priceOfShoes: An integer array, which contains the prices of the pairs of shoes available.
int[] priceOfSkirts: An integer array, which contains the prices of the skirts available.
int[] priceOfTops: An integer array, which contains the prices of the tops available.
int dollars: the total number of dollars available to shop with.

1 ≤ dollars ≤ 109
1 ≤ price of each item ≤ 109
Note: a, b, c and d are the sizes of the four price arrays
