# 1. GRAPH
'''
You are given a tree with V vertices numbered from 1 to N.
The ith edge connects Vertex xi and Vertex yi bidirectionally. You
have to divide this tree into three connected components by cutting
any two edges of the tree. Let the three components be C1,
C2 and C3. Let X1, X2 and X3 be the XOR of all the vertices of the
components C1, C2 and C3 respectively.
Task
Minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum xor
values of the components. In short, you have to minimize the value
of max(X1, X2 ,X3)-min(X1, x2,X3)

# 2. Problem was similar to leetcode 828. Count Unique Characters of All Substrings of a Given String.. 
# It was not exact same little bit modification was there, but similar kind of approach will be used to solve this problem .
