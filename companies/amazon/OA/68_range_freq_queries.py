'''
Given an array of integers -a- and a set of queries of the form [ l, r, x ], your task is to calculate the number of occurrences of the number x in the inclusive subarray a[lâ€¦r] (0-based), for each query, Return the sum of the answers for all queries as the result.

Example

for a=[1,2,1,3,1,2,1] and

arr = [ [1,3,3],
[0,4,1],
[2,5,2],
[5,6,1]
]

The output should be solution(queries) = 6.

-The answer to the first query is 1 : the number 3 appears 1 time in the subarray [2,1,3];

-The answer to the second query is 3: the number 1 appears 3 times in the subarray [1,2,1,3,1]:

-The answer to the third query is 1: the number 2 appears 1 time in the subarray [1,3,1,2];

-The answer to the fourth query is 1 : the number 1 appears 1 time in the subarray [2,1] .

-So the answer is 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 3 seconds (java)

[input] array.integer a

An array of integers.

Guaranteed constraints

1 <= a.length <= 10^4

[input] array.array.integer queries

An array of queries, where queries [ i ] contains three numbers : l , r and x

Guaranteed constraints:
3<= queries.length <= 10^5
queries[ i ].length = 3,
0<= queries[ i ] [ 0 ] <= queries [ i ] [ 1] < a.length
1<= queries [ i ] [ 2 ] <= 100.

[output] integer

The sum of the answers to all queries

Int solution (int[] a , int [] [] queries ){

// solution here
