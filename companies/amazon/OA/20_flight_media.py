Giving back to the community! Recently did the OA for Amazon. I prepped by using this post

1. Flight Media - basically two sums, but you had to account for multiple pairs that could add up to the target
2. Subscriber Groups - similar to https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-provinces/, find the number of unique friend groups
Each question followed up with an explanation on approach and complexity. This was done on Hackerrank.
