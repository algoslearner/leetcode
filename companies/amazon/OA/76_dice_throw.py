Recently I gave Amazon assessment for SDE Intern and the test was of 90 minute. There were two sections A and B.

Section A consist of two Coding Questions -->
First coding question was "find the next maximum permutation of any number" and
Second coding question was "Dice Throw" problem of DP which is available on geeksforgeeks.
Section B consist of 28 MCQs questions purely on Data Structures and on C++ and C based programming.
