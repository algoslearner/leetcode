Hi, I got 2 questions in amazon online asssessment

Given a binary string write an algorithm to calculate minimum number of swaps required to make it a palindrome for eg 11101 requires on swap between 3rd and 4th to make it 11011

Password strength determination - Given a password determine the strength of the password which is calculated by getting substrings in password and calculating strength based on number of unique characters in the substring and adding all the strength
Eg

Good

g - 1
o - 1
o - 1
d -1
go - 2
oo - 1
od- 2
goo - 2
ood - 2
good - 3

total = 16

2262. Total Appeal of A String
Hard

The appeal of a string is the number of distinct characters found in the string.

For example, the appeal of "abbca" is 3 because it has 3 distinct characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
Given a string s, return the total appeal of all of its substrings.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abbca"
Output: 28
Explanation: The following are the substrings of "abbca":
- Substrings of length 1: "a", "b", "b", "c", "a" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 5.
- Substrings of length 2: "ab", "bb", "bc", "ca" have an appeal of 2, 1, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 7.
- Substrings of length 3: "abb", "bbc", "bca" have an appeal of 2, 2, and 3 respectively. The sum is 7.
- Substrings of length 4: "abbc", "bbca" have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.
- Substrings of length 5: "abbca" has an appeal of 3. The sum is 3.
The total sum is 5 + 7 + 7 + 6 + 3 = 28.
Example 2:

Input: s = "code"
Output: 20
Explanation: The following are the substrings of "code":
- Substrings of length 1: "c", "o", "d", "e" have an appeal of 1, 1, 1, and 1 respectively. The sum is 4.
- Substrings of length 2: "co", "od", "de" have an appeal of 2, 2, and 2 respectively. The sum is 6.
- Substrings of length 3: "cod", "ode" have an appeal of 3 and 3 respectively. The sum is 6.
- Substrings of length 4: "code" has an appeal of 4. The sum is 4.
The total sum is 4 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 20.
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.
