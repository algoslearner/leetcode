526. Beautiful Arrangement

Suppose you have n integers labeled 1 through n. 
A permutation of those n integers perm (1-indexed) is considered a beautiful arrangement if for every i (1 <= i <= n), either of the following is true:

perm[i] is divisible by i.
i is divisible by perm[i].
Given an integer n, return the number of the beautiful arrangements that you can construct.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The first beautiful arrangement is [1,2]:
    - perm[1] = 1 is divisible by i = 1
    - perm[2] = 2 is divisible by i = 2
The second beautiful arrangement is [2,1]:
    - perm[1] = 2 is divisible by i = 1
    - i = 2 is divisible by perm[2] = 1
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 15
