364. Nested List Weight Sum II

You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

The depth of an integer is the number of lists that it is inside of. For example, the nested list [1,[2,2],[[3],2],1] has each integer's value set to its depth. Let maxDepth be the maximum depth of any integer.

The weight of an integer is maxDepth - (the depth of the integer) + 1.

Return the sum of each integer in nestedList multiplied by its weight.

 

Example 1:


Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Four 1's with a weight of 1, one 2 with a weight of 2.
1*1 + 1*1 + 2*2 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 8
Example 2:


Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 17
Explanation: One 1 at depth 3, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 1.
1*3 + 4*2 + 6*1 = 17
 

Constraints:

1 <= nestedList.length <= 50
The values of the integers in the nested list is in the range [-100, 100].
The maximum depth of any integer is less than or equal to 50.

Single Pass Solution using a BFS like approach

Add all the integers at level to level_sum. Push all elements which are not interger (and are list type) into the list for next iteration. Make sure to flatten this list otherwise infinite loop.
Now we only initilaize level_sum once. And successive level's integers are added to it. Once a level finishes, we add to total_sum. This naturally implements the multiplication logic - lower level sums are added multiple times to total sum.
