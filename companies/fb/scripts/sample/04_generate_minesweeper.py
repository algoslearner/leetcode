 1. (*high frequency question) Generate a minesweeper grid (2x3) with 3 randomly-placed mines (solution)

Implement Minesweeper
Minesweeper is a game where the objective is correctly identify the location of all mines in a given grid. 
You are given a uniform grid of gray squares in the beginning of the game. 
Each square contains either a mine (indicated by a value of 9), or an empty square. 
Empty squares have a number indicating the count of mines in the adjacent squares. 
Empty squares can have counts from zero (no adjacent mines) up to 8 (all adjacent squares are mines).
If you were to take a complete grid, for example, you can see which squares have mines and which squares are empty:
