'''
Given a string s, return true if the s can be palindrome after deleting at most one character from it.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "aba"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "abca"
Output: true
Explanation: You could delete the character 'c'.
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of lowercase English letters.

'''
We can use the standard two-pointer approach that starts at the left and right of the string and move inwards. Whenever there is a mismatch, we can either exclude the character at the left or the right pointer. We then take the two remaining substrings and compare against its reversed and see if either one is a palindrome.
