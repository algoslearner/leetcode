'''
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
Example 2:

Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s[i] is a printable ascii character.

        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.

        # SC : O(1)
        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1
        while left < right:
            tmp = s[left]
            s[left] = s[right]
            s[right] = tmp
            
            left += 1
            right -= 1
