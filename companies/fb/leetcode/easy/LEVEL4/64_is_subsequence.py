'''
Given two strings s and t, 
return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string 
by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. 
(i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 100
0 <= t.length <= 104
s and t consist only of lowercase English letters.
 

Follow up: Suppose there are lots of incoming s, say s1, s2, ..., sk where k >= 109, 
and you want to check one by one to see if t has its subsequence. 
In this scenario, how would you change your code?

LEFT_BOUND, RIGHT_BOUND = len(s), len(t)

        p_left = p_right = 0
        while p_left < LEFT_BOUND and p_right < RIGHT_BOUND:
            # move both pointers or just the right pointer
            if s[p_left] == t[p_right]:
                p_left += 1
            p_right += 1

        return p_left == LEFT_BOUND
