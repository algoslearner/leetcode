1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II
Medium: Fb 8, Bloomberg 26

You are given a string s and an integer k, a k duplicate removal consists of choosing k adjacent and equal letters from s and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make k duplicate removals on s until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
Example 2:

Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
Example 3:

Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
2 <= k <= 104
s only contains lower case English letters.
